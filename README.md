# *what does the program do?*
well the program starts by asking you to enter a string of only low case
letters and if you enter any other character you will end the string.
after you entered the string  you will get a menue of 3 options:
a. enter a new string - just replace the string with a new one.

b. reverse the string - for example if you enter abc the new string will be cba.

c. check if the string is palindrome - check if the string is a palindrome and return true or false.


## *things that the user can do:*
1. you can enter a string.
2. you can check if a word is a palindrome.
3. you can reverse words.


### *images of running the program:*

- in this picture we see how does the program reverse and get a string.

- in that picture we can see how does the program look when checking for palindrome.

#### *development phases:*
1. at the begining I started by adding a way to get a string so I used  "push" for that - I made a loop that will keep asking the user for chars
until he enters a wrong char and lenght counter.
2. later I made the menue with some messeges and the option choose.
3. for the "enter a new string" option I used the length counter to
empty the last string and then just to get a new one.
4. for the "reverse" option I made a system that will count from last
to first and from first to last and in each turn the to letters
get swaped and a counter system so the swaping will stop when it gets
to the midle of the string so it wont swap twice and get back to normal.
5. for the "check if palindrome" option I made to counters like in the reverse option but instead of swaping it compares the two letters.

##### *what I would add:*
well I would add an exit option that would finish the program and a
string showing option.

###### *how did it feel?*
it felt good to finish the project
in the reverse part I had to fix it more than several times
for it to work and I felt bad and anxious
 so it felt so good to finally be done.
